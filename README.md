# Paper

A native Node.js addon for MacOS that boosts the clipboard (Apple Universal Clipboard).

- Read and write (to) the clipboard
- Automate tasks on copy, with "plugins" (transcribe audio files, replace certain strings in texts, process images etc...)

# Why?
There were moments in which I received whatsapp audios and I could not listen to them, so why not taking advantage of the fact you can copy them with the iPhone and paste them on Macbook and transcribe them? 
Why not automating the process?

## Test it


```bash
# This will install the necessary dependencies as well as compile the native part
pnpm install
```

```bash
node examples/basic_usage.js 
```

Develop and replace with your own scripts

## Watch mode
